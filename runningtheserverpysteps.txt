Run The FYLEHW flask app:
Our main py file to be run is server.py stored in core folder
So steps are:
1. Code to be written in terminal:
$env:FLASK_APP = "core\server.py"
del .\core\store.sqlite3
flask db upgrade -d core\migrations\

2.
.\run.bat

The server would be running on http://127.0.0.1:8080
